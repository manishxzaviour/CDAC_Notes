- when there is a is-a relation
-
- > super class -> sub class
-
- all members of the super class are inherited into the sub classes
-
- [[types of inheritance]]
- [[super]]
- [[upcasting]] [[downcasting]]
-
- `extends` is used to declare the inheritance from the super class
	- ```
	  class Sub extends Super{...}
	  ```
	- can be used to declare inheritance for #[[abstract class]]
- `implements` is used to declare support for #interface
	- ```
	  Class X implements clonable{...}
	  ```
- java does not support modes of inheritance
