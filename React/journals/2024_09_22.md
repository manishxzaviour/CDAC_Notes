- react apps are made out of components
- a #component is a piece of ui that has its own logic and appearance
- ## components are javascript functions that return markup
- ```
  function Btn(){
  return(
  	<button> b1 </button> -- javascript object
  );
  }
  
  export default function MyApp(){
  	return(
      	<div>
          	<Btn/>
          </div>
      );
  } //export default for specifying main component of the file 	
  ```
