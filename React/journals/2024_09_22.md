- react apps are made out of components
- a #component is a piece of ui that has its own logic and appearance
- ## components are javascript functions that return markup
- ```
  function Btn(){
  return(
  	<button> b1 </button> -- javascript object
  );
  }
  
  export default function MyApp(){
  	return(
      	<div>
          	<Btn/>
          </div>
      );
  } //export default for specifying main component of the file 	
  ```
-
- __a function cannot return more than one object__
	- all elements should be enclosed in one parent tag
- javascript function are camel case
- react components are pascal case
	- html must be lowercase
	-
- the markup used is called #JSX
	- jsx is stricter than html
	- only one object can be returned
		- can return objects in a empty wrapper
		- ```
		  <>
		  //comp
		  </>
		  ```
-
- a html element can have a className
	- jsx can also have className
-
- JSX can have markup to insert data in your element
- ```
  return(
  	# 
      {user.name}
      
  
  );
  ```
  ```
  style={{width: user.imageSize}}
  ```
	-
- **no special syntax for conditons**
	- use js if for conditions before return
	- operator work inside jsx
	-
- #render
	- components need to be rendered in order to put into the DOM
	- the `default function` is redered automatically on page load
-
- #[[event Handler]]
	- respond to events by declaring event handler inside component
		- ```
		  function Btn(){
		      function handleClick(){}
		      return (
		                    <button onclick={handleClick}>
		                     click
		                     </button>
		  
		  );
		  }
		  ```
-
- to have #stored data members
	- ```
	  import {useState} from 'react';
	  ```
	- ```
	  function abc(){
	  const [count, setCount]= useState(0);
	  }
	  ```
	- the current state, and the function that is used to update it.
	- first time call count will be 0 as 0 is passed to useState.
	  calling setCount passing new value will increment the count
	- ```
	  function MyButton(){
	           const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	           function handleClick()
	           {setCount(count+1);}
	  return ();
	  }
	  ```
	- the component function is called on and on.
	- each jsx object will have different stored variable 
	  ,value of the variable does not change for all objects if the update is invoked for one function
- #hooks
	- functions starting with use are called hooks.
	- useState is a built in hook provided by reacr
	- __hooks are more restrictive than other functions__
	- you can only call hooks at the top of your component
