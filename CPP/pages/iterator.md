- a object that enables traversal over elements of a container and provides access to these elements
- are used to abstract the element traversal
- allow to move through container one element at a time
- provide access to the element they point to
- type specific
-
- __input iterator__ allow read and single pass access i.e only move forward
- __output iterator__ allow write and single pass access
- __forward iterator__ allow read and write with multi pass access i.e go through multiple times
- __bi-directional iterators__ can move forward and backwards
- __random access iterators__ allow direct access to any element using arithmetic operators
