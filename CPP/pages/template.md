- used to improve reusability
- to genericise code so that it is not type dependent
- temlate<tyename T> or  <class T> both are functionally same
- T can be used as a placeholder like a [[macro]] that will be replaced by compiler at compile time
- functions and classes can be made into templates
- incase of functions use typename and in case of class use class
- explicit type specifying is required in case of template class
