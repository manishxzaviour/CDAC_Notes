- initialize a object with values of another object
- if no copy constructor is defined default [[copy constructor]] is added
-
- copies all the non-satatic data members as is
- used to copy normal primitive and derived types
- should not be performed if class contains pointer type members
-
- if sallow copy is performed with a class having pointers the address of that pointer is copied as is and not the pointed content
- the address of already allocated mem is passed to the copy
- no new mem is allocated within the new object as the constructor does
- when the destructors are called the dtor of copied object is called first which frees the allocated mem assigned by og object
- later og tries to free the same location through its dtor
- thus free is called on a already freed location
- if the og class object eddits its data the same changes will be reflected in the copied class object
-
- to avoid this [[deep copy]] is performed
