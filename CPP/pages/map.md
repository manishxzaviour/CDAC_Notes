- collection of key-value pairs
- sorted by keys
- keys are sorted by using a comparison function
- keys are unique
- search, removal , insertion have logarithmic complexity
- iterator iterate in ascending order of keys
- map<type key, type value> a;
- a[key]=value
- map<>::iterator itr = a.begin()
- itr-> first => key
- itr-> second => value
- if key already exists its value is replaced in assignment
-
- bi directional iterator
