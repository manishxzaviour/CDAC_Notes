- achieved using [[late binding]], [[up casting]], [[overriding]] , [[virtual keyword]], [[abstract class]]
-
- a shape class exists
- contains
- accept , calculateArea [[pure virtual function]]
- is a [[abstract class]]
- ---
- class circle exists and inherits from class shape
- overrides accept and calculteArea
- accept accepts radius
- calculateArea return area
- ---
- class rectangle exists and inherits from class shape
- overrides accept and calculteArea
- accept accepts length , breadth
- calculateArea return area
- ---
- Shape *sptr;
- sptr can be assigned new Circle()
- sptr can be assigned new Rect()
- this can be done at runtime the functions accept and calculate perform different operations when called by sptr if it is pointing to circle or rect by [[late binding]]
- thus [[runtime polymorphism]] is achieved
