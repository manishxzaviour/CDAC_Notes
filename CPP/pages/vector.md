- a dynamic array that can grow and shrink in size
- provides random access to elements and efficient insertion and deletion at the end
- vector<int> v1;
- inspectors size() capacity() begin() end()
- facilitators push_back() erase() clear() at()
- iterator vector<type>::iterator
- is a random access iterator
- [] can be used to index elements in the base array
- [] is overloaded to work with vector object
- size of vector doubles on insertion every time its size is full
-
- data is inserted at the end
- inserting at the end takes differential time as when full array needs to be extended
- removing the last element takes constant time as no resizing happens
- inserting in beginning or middle takes linear time
