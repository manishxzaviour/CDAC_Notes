- used in inheritance
- to solve [[dimond-problem]]
- to perform [[overriding]]
- when a function or class is inherited as virtual its entry is made in a vTable is created. a vptr to this table is added to the derived class
- when access to this inherited member is required the entry in vTable is passed
- when multiple instances of the same objects are inherited only one entry is strored inside the vTable thus solving the [[dimond-problem]]
- when a function is to be overridden in the derived class its entry is added to the vTable overriding the entry of overriden virtual function
- if any function of the base class is virtual the vptr is added to all derived classes
- the function overriding also becomes virtual
