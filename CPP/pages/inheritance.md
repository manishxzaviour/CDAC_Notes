- part of [[hierarchy]]
- is-a relation
- having similar behaviours [[object]]
- to increase reusability
- _all the non-static data members of base class are allocated memory inside derived class object_
- except constructors, destructors, copy constructors and friend functions
- when the derived class object is created , the constructor of base class is called first and the constructor of derived after that
- the object of base class is a dependency for the derived class
- the base class constructor is called as it is not inherited into the derived class but the non-static members are inherited which need initialization
-
- when going out of scope the distructors are called in reverse order of constructor calls
-
- types of inheritance -
- [[single inheritance]] [[multiple inheritance]] [[hierarchical inheritance]] [[multilevel inheritance]] [[hybrid inheritance]]
