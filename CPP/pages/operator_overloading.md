- operator overloading does not change the basic functionality of the operation
- just overloads the operator function to function differently based on context
- the 'operator' keyword is used to overide the operator function
- the operator function can be overloaded as a member or non-member(as a [[friend]] ) function
- operators like the -> , = and [] need to be overloaded as member functions
- operators sizeof(), [[typeid()]], :: and ?: cannot be overloaded
