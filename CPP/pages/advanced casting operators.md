- [[const_cast]]
- advanced casting operators provide additional information about its operands like its nature(polymorphic) and its inheritance
- dynamic_cast
- > in case of polymorphic class to downcast use dynamic_cast
- >checks type conversion as well as inheritance between source and destination at run time
- if fails return null
- In case of reference, fails downcasting then it throws std::bad_cast
  exception
- ---
- static cast
- in case of non polymorphic between compatible types
- does not check whether type conversion is valid
- >only checks inheritance at compile time
-
- reinterprit cast
- const cast
