- >>Q1. Write a class to find volume of a Cylinder by using following members. (volume of
  Cylinder=3.14 * radius * radius *height) ( use static wherever needed. hint-PI)
  Class having following member functions:
  Cylinder()
  Cylinder(double radius, double height)
  getRadius()
  setRadius()
  getHeight()
  setHeight()
  calculateVolume()
  Initialize members using constructor member initializer list
- >>Q2. Write a class for Time and provide the functionality
  Time()
  Time(int h,int m,int s)
  getHour()
  getMinute()
  getSeconds()
  printTime()
  setHour()
  setMinute()
  setSeconds()
  In main create array of objects of Time.
  Allocate the memory for the array and the object dynamically.
- >>Q3. Stack is a Last-In-First-Out data structure. Write a Stack class that stores int type of data. It
  implements stack using Dynamically allocated array. Stack size should be passed in parameterized
  constructor. If size is not given, allocate stack of size 5.
  Provide member functions like push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty(), isFull(), and print().
