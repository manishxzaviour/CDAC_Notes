- did assignment day 5 q3 first
- did not compile yesterday
- errors were nonsensical
- turns out it was related to inheritance
- when inheriting a base class the constructor of base class is called first the of the derived class
- was assigning uninitialize variables value in derived class constructor
- object of base class was not created but i was passing the values for its members in the derived class constructor through initializer list
- initializer list is executed during object creation and not after object creation
- so the derived constrctor was asigning values to members of non existant object
- pitfall : over use of initializer list
- when the same values are passed in body : error free
- object creation sequence matters in inheritance
- ___
- assignment day 6 q2 done first as it was simple
- q1 is just yesterdays q3 with menu
- so priority was to fix q3 first done just to fix the double calling of indirect base class functions to be done by protected setter and getter functions
- will do revision now 4.00
