	- can contain null
	- adding zero or more attributes to the candidate key generates a super key
- alternate key
	- all candidate keys other than the primary key
	- it is a secondary key
- foreign key
	- in a referential relation, a key that acts as a primary key in one table and a secondary key in another table
- composite key
	- when a single attribute cannot be used as a primary key to represent multiple attributes can be combined to form the primary key
-
- views
	- compiled at run time
	- can be made over one or more database tables
