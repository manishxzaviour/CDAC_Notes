- interface Set<E>
- to store non-duplicate elements.
- does not guaranty order retention
- > duplicity is not allowed
  null values are allowed
-
- based on a hash table
-
- implemented by
	- #HashSet, {{cloze override hashCode and equals. if two elements generate the same hash code they can be added to the bucket; only if they are different. the equals method is used to check if element already exists in the bucked. if does not exist; added into the bucket. hashCode and equals should be performed on the same identity fields.}}
	- #LinkedHashSet, {{cloze override hashCode and equals}}
	- #TreeSet {{cloze override compareTo}}
-
- ```
  Set<Integer> s1 = new HashSet<>();
  s1.add(null);
  s1.remove(null); //will remove the null value
  
  s1.add(1); // successfull
  s1.add(1); // will return false; will not throw exception
  
  s1.add(new Employee(5,"Ram",5000)); // successfull
  s1.add(new Employee(5,"Ram",5000)); // successfull
  // the hash codes generated by default hash method of object are different
  ```
-
- to avoid duplicates in non-primitive elements the `hashCode` and the `equals` method of the object class needs to be `overriden`
-
- contract that if the hashCode is equal only then the Objects are equal
	- does not store duplicates
- ```
  class X => 
  int hashCode(){
  	return Object.hash(objState);
  }
  boolean equals(Object o) {...}
  ```
