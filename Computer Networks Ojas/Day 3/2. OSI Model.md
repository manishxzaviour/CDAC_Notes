**OSI Model Overview**:
- The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in the late 1970s.
- It is a **standard for network communication**, providing a framework to understand and implement different communication protocols.

**Role of ISO in Standardization**:
- The **ISO** is responsible for defining various global standards, including those for **weights, volume (e.g., liter), distance (e.g., kilometer), length (e.g., meter), time (e.g., seconds)**, and more.
- **ISO certification** is given to companies that meet certain quality standards, ensuring they follow **standardized processes**.

**Why Standardization is Important**?
- **Standardization** is crucial for ensuring **flawless communication** between different networks and devices.
- Without these standards, communication across diverse systems and networks could become **inconsistent** or **error-prone**, making global connectivity difficult.
### **7 Layers**

| **Layers Of OSI Model** |
| :---------------------: |
|    Application Layer    |
|   Presentation Layer    |
|      Session Layer      |
|     Transport Layer     |
|      Network Layer      |
|     Datalink Layer      |
|     Physical Layer      |

1. **Application Layer**: Handles user data and interfaces with software applications.
2. **Presentation Layer**: Formats data and manages encryption, compression, etc.
3. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions and connections.
4. **Transport Layer**: Manages data transfer (TCP/UDP) and error checking (encapsulation creates segments here).
5. **Network Layer**: Adds source and destination IPs, creating packets.
6. **Data Link Layer**: Adds MAC addresses, CRC for error checking, and creates frames.
7. **Physical Layer**: Transmits raw bits over the physical medium (e.g., cables, voltages).

- **Sender’s Process**: Data is encapsulated as it moves down layers (Data → Segment → Packet → Frame → Bits).
- **Receiver’s Process**: Data is decapsulated as it moves up layers (Bits → Frame → Packet → Segment → Data).
