A network is a system of interconnected entities that can communicate with each other.
**Need for Resource Sharing:**
- **Data, Voice, Video:** These are common examples of resources shared over networks, such as file sharing, VoIP, and video streaming or conferencing.

**History of Networks:**
    
- **IBM's PC (1981):** IBM introduced the Personal Computer (PC) in 1981, which was significant because, unlike earlier systems where one microprocessor was shared by multiple users (mainframes), each person now had their own dedicated microprocessor. 
- **PC-XT (1983):** IBM's next advancement was the PC-XT, which added features like a hard drive. However, IBM's decision to use open architecture allowed other companies (SeaGate and Intel) to replicate and sell cheaper versions of the PC. 
- **Impact of IBM's Open Architecture:** IBM's strategy of open architecture allowed companies like Intel and Seagate to manufacture compatible parts. This led to the rise of assembled PCs, which became popular due to their affordability.
