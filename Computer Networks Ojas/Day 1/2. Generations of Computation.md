**1st Generation:** Centralized computation (e.g., mainframes where multiple users accessed a single system).
**2nd Generation:** Unlike the 1st generation's centralized model, decentralized computation allowed for multiple systems or devices to operate independently or with minimal coordination. Each computer had its processing power and could run its own programs. The scalability of decentralized systems was a challenge. While they could handle more computers than a single mainframe, there was still a limit to the number of devices they could support. Managing and maintaining the network became increasingly complex as more computers were added.
**3rd Generation:** Client-Server Networks – These systems could manage more devices (clients) than decentralized systems. Servers could be upgraded to accommodate more clients. Examples include database servers like MySQL and Oracle.
**4th Generation:** Cloud Computing – Cloud services include:
	- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Cloud-hosted servers.
	- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Applications accessed over the internet (e.g., Microsoft 365).
	- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Platforms that provide infrastructure for software development.
	- **Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS):** Platforms that offer communication services, like chatbots.
	- Cloud computing became prominent after 2010. It offers many advantages, though cost remains a consideration. Despite this, it has been widely adopted.
