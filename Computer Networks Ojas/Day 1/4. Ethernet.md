**Ethernet and Networking Concepts:**
    
**Ethernet Overview:** Ethernet is a widely used networking technology governed by IEEE standards, with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps. Variants include Metro Ethernet and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE).
**Token Ring:** An older networking technology with speeds of 4 Mbps and 16 Mbps, phased out due to limited speed.
**How Ethernet Works:**
    **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection):** Older Ethernet operated on this protocol, managing how devices send and receive data. Modern Ethernet largely uses switches that eliminate collisions.
    **MAC Address:** Each device has a unique MAC address (48 bits), with the first 24 bits being the Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) governed by IEEE, and the remaining 24 bits representing the device's serial number.
    **Collision Detection and Backoff Algorithm:** In older Ethernet, if two devices tried to send data simultaneously, a collision would occur. Devices would back off and retry transmission after a random time (determined by the Backoff Algorithm). Modern Ethernet switches reduce these collisions.
**Communication Methods:**
    **Unicast:** One-to-one communication.
    **Broadcast:** One-to-all communication, using a special MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
**Drawbacks of Older Ethernet:** Increased collisions and limited media availability were issues with older Ethernet technologies (e.g., hubs). Modern Ethernet with switches mitigates these problems.
